class RacetrackEnv(object) :
    """
    Class representing a race-track environment inspired by exercise 5.12 in Sutton & Barto 2018 (p.111).
    Please do not make changes to this class - it will be overwritten with a clean version when it comes to marking.

    The dynamics of this environment are detailed in this coursework exercise's jupyter notebook, although I have
    included rather verbose comments here  for those of you who are interested in how the environment has been
    implemented (though this should not impact your solution code).

    If you find any *bugs* with this code, please let me know immediately - thank you for finding them, sorry that I didn't!
    However, please do not suggest optimisations - some things have been purposely simplified for readability's sake.
